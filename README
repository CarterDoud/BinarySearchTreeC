***************************
Description
***************************
This assignment implements a personal assistant using a binary search tree. The program reads a data file with rules containing keywords and responses.
The program can add/remove and modify rules.
The program will respond to questions based upon the level of significance of words in the question.

***************************
Running Program
***************************

To compile the program, navigate to the main directory for the assignment and use the command "make"
To run the program, use the command "./bin/program <INPUT FILE>" where <INPUT FILE> is a properly formatted text document
A sample file has been included in the docs directory
To compile the test program, navigate to the main directory for the assignment and use the command "make test"
To run the test program, use the command "./bin/testing"

***************************
Testing
***************************
The test program tests the tree with normal values.

***************************
Limitations
***************************
getHeight function considers null nodes as having 0 height, and the leafs as 1. Some height algorithims work with this principle, some treat leafs as having height 0.
input is case sensitive
does not allow for duplicate keywords
output format isn't perfect

***************************
Personalization
***************************
Recursive functions were added to perform tree functions. The API calls in this assignment do not enable the use of reccursion normally.
The API calls merely call the recursive functions.
